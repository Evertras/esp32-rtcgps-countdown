# RTC + GPS Countdown for ESP32

Playing around with RTC + GPS combo to automatically set the RTC using GPS.
Technically the RTC probably isn't necessary if we're getting steady data from
GPS, but hey, why not.

Also the ESP32 has its own RTC, so let's use that as a backup.

Just a fun reference playground!
